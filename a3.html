              I embarked on an animation project to bring a word to life through
              color transitions, aiming to convey the essence of Happiness. The
              color selection was carefully curated, encompassing a wide
              spectrum of hues. Alongside the vibrant colors, I incorporated a
              bouncing circle to add dynamism, as it presented a compelling
              challenge to animate with an authentic bounce effect. Throughout
              the process, I encountered the challenge of familiarizing myself
              with shortcuts and discerning which properties governed specific
              elements, but this hurdle was overcome with persistence and
              practice.
