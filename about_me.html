My names Nurul Shehab, I am a 19-year-old first-year student at BMCC who is passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge. One class that has truly caught my interest is MMP100, where I have thoroughly enjoyed the lessons and valuable insights gained throughout the course. Despite having prior knowledge of many of the topics covered, I remained enthusiastic about deepening my understanding and exploring new perspectives.

In my free time, I indulge in various hobbies that bring me joy and inspiration. Video games have always been a source of entertainment and fascination for me, allowing me to immerse myself in captivating virtual worlds. Animation and drawing are also cherished pursuits of mine, as they offer a creative outlet for self-expression and a means to bring characters and stories to life. Additionally, I find great pleasure in watching movies, exploring diverse genres and narratives that ignite my imagination.

Continuing to explore these interests and expand my skills in these areas is a continuous journey that excites me. I look forward to further growth and the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for video games, animation, drawing, and the captivating world of cinema.
